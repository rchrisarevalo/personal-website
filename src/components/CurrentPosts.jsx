                    Furthermore, I should be able to continue making updates to this website from this point on, now that the semester is near
                    its end. In further news, I will be making a new feature in the next few months. I still haven't given it some thought,
                    but it's a small feature that I am planning to make. I will reveal in a later announcement what it will be about.

                    It's been a very difficult 3 weeks. There has been a lot of work piling on me, and it was difficult to keep up with everything,
                    hence my decision to shut down this website for the aforementioned time period. But luckily, I managed to get through most of it,
                    and my workload should be lighter than it has been during these last few weeks.

                    As this is a matter of education, my education in fact, these circumstances qualify for the "Personal Affairs" section to be
                    invoked. This is probably the first time I had to use the Site Operation policy in times like these. In contrast to the section
                    stating that the website won't be necessarily shut down, I am going to have to, at least for the next two to three weeks.
                    This change will take effect on Saturday, April 9, midnight.

                    My circumstances have become a little bit complicated. I hope to come back before the end of the month so I can announce whether or
                    not I will be creating a blog. If not, then I will come back in the first week of May. The workload should be lighter by then, except
                    for a poster for a presentation that I have to do.

                    Good afternoon. I am announcing that I will be taking a leave of absence for the next 2-3 weeks. The reason for why I am taking
                    this leave of absence is because due to this month being the last full month of the semester before the end of May (when the
                    semester ends), I am going to have to stay focused now more than ever. I have a very important assignment due at the end of the
                    semester, on top of dealing with other homework assignments, quizzes, and exams.

                    But honestly, I am going to continue maintaining this website whenever I have free time in my hands and
                    if I have less work to do than usual. This month will be important as it is the month before finals. I
                    am going to need to use my time wisely if I am going to have a good chance of obtaining my degree next
                    year and pass all my courses.
