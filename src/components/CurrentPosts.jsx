                be wiped out completely and be replaced with posts for the new month.

                    I will be working on the website and design a user interface as we approach the next new year
                    (2022). So if I don't post any announcements for the majority of this month, it's because I
                    am on break in addition to making updates to this website. I sincerely apologize for any
                    inconvenience that might occur along the way, such as not responding to messages from y'all
                    in a timely manner.

                    Good evening, everyone. I know I am on a hiatus right now for the next two weeks, but I wanted
                    to leave this message here for anyone visiting this website to let y'all know that I am not
                    going to be posting any content here during the holidays, especially right now.

                    As you all may have noticed, another font change has occurred. I did this because I thought
                    that the old font used for the previous 2-3 months was boring, and I thought it was time for
                    a change. But it looks good, and hopefully y'all enjoy it as well!

                    After that's all said and done, I will focus on providing a new user interface for this website
                    sometime during January or February, if time permits, as I will be back in school for another
                    semester during that time.

                    Hi everyone! Sorry for the late changes, but I was busy with college as finals are already
                    approaching. In addition, I might not post as often as I do this month because I have decided
                    to take a 2-week hiatus from updating this site starting on December 13 and ending on December 27,
                    right after Christmas.
