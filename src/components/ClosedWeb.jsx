                    In accordance to the new website operation policy I have implemented in the last month,
                    I decided to close this website today on December 19, 2021. Since the holiday week starts
                    tomorrow, I have decided that it was the best idea to close this website and open it up
                    again right after Christmas ends. However, the possibility of closing this website until
                    the end of New Year's is not ruled out yet. I will update this page on Christmas Eve when I
                    make my final decision.
