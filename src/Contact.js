        <h1>Contact Information</h1>
        <p>
            If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me through my email, <a href="mailto:rubenplayer105@gmail.com" id="contact-link"><b>rubenplayer105@gmail.com</b></a>,
            LinkedIn, or Github. The links for both my LinkedIn and Github profiles are located on the footer below.

            If you have any complaints or issues with this website, please feel free to click on the
            report button on the web version. On the mobile version, to submit a report, click on
            the warning icon on the top right corner of the header.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will most likely respond to complaints/reports in about 3-5 days. If I am super available
            (meaning if I literally have nothing to do), then I might respond to your issue much earlier 
            than anticipated response time provided above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have a nice day, everyone!
        </p>
