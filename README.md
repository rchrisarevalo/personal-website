# Personal Website (v3.11.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on May 16, 2023):

* The following changes have been made to the site:
  * A major user interface (UI) update was made to the website.
    * The navigation bar has gone on the web version has gone through some changes, as the 'Settings' option has now been moved to the right hand side.

    * Regarding the 'Settings' option, its respective page has been removed, and the options have been moved to a modal window. This was done as there
      were only two settings to choose from, and as well to provide for an easier user experience for those using the Site.

    * The 'About Me' page has been redesigned completely, with the introduction section, recent posts section, and gallery section being affected.
      In addition to using my own design implementations, I also used the React Bootstrap library (which was used to design other pages as well) to redesign 
      the front page to make it more presentable, with a Carousel derived from React Bootstrap being used to condense the images together into one slideshow.

    * The contact form's character limit has been increased to 500 characters. This was done to allow people to type longer messages that they wouldn't
      fit when the form originally allowed only a maximum of 300 characters to be typed in.
