# Personal Website (v2.14.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on February 5, 2022):

* New features were added for this update:
    * A new Settings page was added to this Site. It provides a few options for now, as I plan to expand on it in the future.
    * The aforementioned new features that I mentioned are the ability to clean any local storage stored for this site on the user's browser.
    * The user has the ability to change from light mode to dark mode and vice versa. This feature was finally re-integrated into this site after improvements were made.
    * For the changes to take effect fully, however, the user must save these changes. Fortunately, a "Save" button is provided for the user to make these changes.
