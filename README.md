# Personal Website (v2.9.2)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on November 20, 2021):

* I made the following announcement in the website as to how it is going to operate in the future, especially during the holidays:
    * Starting this Thanksgiving, every time a holiday approaches, the website will close in observance of that holiday.

* I also updated some information in the "Contact" page, removing a section of the page that included info as to how to report bugs through the "Report" button (which has been removed).
