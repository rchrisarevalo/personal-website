# Personal Website (v3.9.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on December 19, 2022):

* The following changes have been made to the site:
  * A table was added to the "Archives" page.
  * The table should give a clearer perspective as to how much time an archive will be available before it hits its expirationd date.
  * The amount of time left as shown in the table will automatically update itself yearly.
  * Changes will be made to the table each time an archive is added on a monthly basis.
