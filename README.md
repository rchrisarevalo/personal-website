# Personal Website (v3.0.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on May 24, 2022):

* I made some major changes to the infrastructure of this website:
  * Updating react-router-dom to v6.
  * Updating the rendering of the page to match that of React v1.18 and above.
* This was all done so that my website's infrastructure is up-to-date.
* Additional credits were added to give credit to the author of some of the snippets and ideas of their code I used, namely the light to dark theme feature.
