# Personal Website (v3.3.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on July 21, 2022):

* I have made the following changes to the website:
  * A character counter was added to the form so that it makes it easier for users to keep track of how many characters they have left for their form.
  * Furthermore, I added new tips on the contact form page as to what one can and cannot do when sending a message through the site.
  * Some bug fixes.

* I will continue to **make updates** whenever I have time, as I will get busy later on this month and in early August.
