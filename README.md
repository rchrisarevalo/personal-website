# Personal Website (v3.0.1)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on June 2, 2022):

* A bug fix was made to the countdown feature/section in the "About Me" page, as it was displaying unusual percentages (e.g. over 1000%) whenever I set today's date to a later date in the year of 2023.

* The progress countdown feature should work as intended.
