# Personal Website (v2.19.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on May 20, 2022):

* The new changes for this version are as follows:
    * A new, separate page for the contact form has been added. It can be found by clicking the "Contact" link in the navigation bar above.
    * A graduation countdown has been added to the front of the page so that others, most importantly, future recruiters, can have an idea
      of when I am going to graduate.
    * Style changes were made to accommodate the visualization of the contact form in its new environment (the "Contact" page).
