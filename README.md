# Personal Website (v2.16.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on March 29, 2022):

* The footer div classes have been replaced with React Bootstrap components to make it appear more organized.
    * I will continue to do this as time progresses. The use of React Bootstrap components will make designing this website a little bit easier than before.
    * However, custom-made classes will still be made, either for buttons, forms, etc.
* Dependency vulnerabilities have been addressed.
* New profile pic has been added! :)
