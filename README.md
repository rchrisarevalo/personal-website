# Personal Website (v3.2.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on July 16, 2022):

* I have made the following changes to the website:
  * I have added a new feature to the "Settings" page. Whenever a user first enters the website, it automatically configured to the theme they chose in their OS (operating system) settings.
  * Furthermore, I have made some bug fixes, such as fixing style errors in the user interface, as well as improving how the copyright year state automatically updates after New Year's Eve.

* I will continue to **make updates** whenever I have time, as I will get busy later on this month and in early August.
