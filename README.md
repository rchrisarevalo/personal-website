# Personal Website (v3.5.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on August 24, 2022):

* The following changes have been made to the site:
  * Instead of manually adding a div element for each post, I used a combination of JSON files
  and the Axios library to submit GET and POST requests when retrieving the information from
  the JSON file in the database folder and when creating new posts, respectively.
  * The same update applies to the Update Message that is displayed every once in a while.
    * The availability of the Update Message box will be set from the administrator page, which
    is available only when I activate it when I use VSCode.


* I will continue to **make updates** whenever I have time, as I will get busy later on this month and in early August.
