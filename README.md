# Personal Website (v2.12.2)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on January 7, 2022):

* Dependency updates were made to the package-lock.json file to address vulenerabilities that were caught by Dependabot.
    
* So for now, I am sticking with the downgraded react-router-dom version (v5.3.0) until the situation is resolved. I want to keep the infrastructure of this site up-to-date to make sure it is sustainable in the future.
