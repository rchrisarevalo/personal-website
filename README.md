# Personal Website (v2.12.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on January 1, 2022):

* Major changes were made to the website:
    * A new "Archive" page has been added.
        * This was done to allow the user to easily access old announcements based on month and year.
        * The "Archive" page will continue to be updated every month after which the "Announcements" page is wiped clean and the old posts from the previous month are stored in its respective archive.

    * New works have been added.
        * While it may not seem so significant, this was the first time in a while that I managed to add new photos I have taken over from the last time I included a photo until now. I tried to include some on my website, but I did not have the time to do so due to finals and familial obligations.

    * The "Contact Me" page has been removed, as well as my email address.
        * I decided to remove the page, along with my email contact information. The reason for this is because I noticed that some people have been sending me spam emails to malicious links that can allow for a virus to seep in to either my computer or phone, which can be consequential for the wrong reasons. I do not want any further problems so that's why I decided to take this course of action.
        * The decision to include my email again on this page will probably be up in the air for a while as I will be busy by the time I return to college for the Spring 2022 semester.

    * Some descriptions have been changed:
        * You may notice what used to be the "Works" section has been renamed to "Portfolio". The latter sounds more fitting since a portfolio allows me to include other works from outside of my field of study and not worrying about including pictures of my work involving the use of programming and software engineering concepts.
