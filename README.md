# Personal Website (v2.18.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on May 11, 2022):

* Good news, everyone! I managed to include a contact form from formspree.io that allows anyone to send a message to me! I was surprised that this was able to work with a static website, given that a real contact form would require the use of a backend (e.g. Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) to be able to send messages through email.

* In addition, I made a few changes to the user interface of this site.

* I hope you all enjoy the new changes!
