# Personal Website (v2.13.0)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on January 11, 2022):

* I have added a new policy to the Site:
    * **Archival Policy**: This policy (or outline) will explain how the archival process works. It covers topics such as how many days are the announcements archived, how long they are kept available, etc.

* I also added a new feature to the Site as well:
    * Progress bar by nProgress (author: rstacruz):
        * I added a progress bar using the nProgress bar made by rstacruz a few years ago. This library was used under the MIT license, with the nprogress being installed as a dependency. All copyright
        notices belonging to the author should be within the respective files used to access the progress bar made by rstacruz.
