# Personal Website (v2.12.1)

* This website was made using React.js.
* Updates are made every week or so, depending on how busy I am.

# UPDATES (made on January 6, 2022):

* Bug fixes were made on this website:
    * React-router-dom dependency was downgraded to v5.
    * The reason for this decision was due to the terminal preventing me from deploying new changes to the Site as a result of the new react-router-dom v6.
    * I tried to make the change from the Switch component to the Routes component, but it also gave me an error as well.
    
* So for now, I am sticking with react-router-dom v5.3.0 until the situation is resolved. I want to keep the infrastructure of this site up-to-date to make sure it is sustainable in the future.
