Fun facts I want to share about myself are that I love to code, listen to music (preferrably lofi, classical, and pop), play video games, and watch movies and shows in my free time. Since I was a high school student, I always found the concept of programming intriguing, thinking about how much over a million (or a few) lines of code can change the world in so many ways. This led to me to develop a huge interest in learning about software development, since there are so many software programs out there in the Internet, whether they'd be web applications, server-side applications, etc. Regardless of whether an app is either in the web or in our phones, it has changed the way our infrastructure works, as well as impacted many of our choices when it comes to utilizing services online.
